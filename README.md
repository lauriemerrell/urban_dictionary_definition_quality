# Urban Dictionary Definition Quality

Text classifcation project to predict good, controversial, and bad Urban Dictionary definitions based on the [Urban Dictionary Words and Definitions dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/therohk/urban-dictionary-words-dataset). For these purposes "controversial" means that users gave the definition a mix of good and bad ratings; it does not relate to whether the term being defined or the definition is "controversial" from the perspective of factual correctness or common standards (beyond those expressed by users' votes).


Note: By the nature of Urban Dictionary, there are some offensive words, including very harmful slurs, contained in some of the outputs of this project (for example, the exploratory data analysis notebook). I do not promote or condone the use of these words and warn users/readers in advance that these words may be present.
